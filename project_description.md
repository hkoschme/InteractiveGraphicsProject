#  Task 1:  Create an Interactive, Web-Based, Data Vizualization Tool via Shiny

**(12% of your Final Grade)**

Your primary task in this project is to design an interactive, web-based, data visualization tool via Shiny to explore and analyze your dataset.

##  App Templates

See [here](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) for a bunch of really nice Shiny templates.

##  App Set-Up Requirements

1.  Each group is required to use a Shiny theme or to design and use your own Shiny theme from scratch.  For more info, see here: 

+  [https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/10/13/shinythemes-1-1-1/]
+  [https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/]

2.  Each group is required to use Shiny Dashboard in their Shiny app.  For more information on Shiny Dashboard, see here:

+  [https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/]
+  [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shinydashboard/index.html]

3.  Each group's app should be hosted publicly on [RStudio's ShinyApps Website](https://www.shinyapps.io/).  At least one person in your group should create a free account to do this.


##  Graph Requirements

1.  Each group member is required to create two graphics.  Groups with four members are required to have eight graphs in your Shiny app, and groups with three members are required to have six graphs.

2.  All graphs must have some interactive (e.g. via Shiny interactivity, Plotly, etc) or dynamic (e.g. animation) aspect to them.

3.  It's the end of the semester, so the graphs you make should be perfect.  Take care to create excellent graphs that are informative and easy to understand.  All graphs should be properly labeled, titled, etc.

4.  Each group can have no more than two graphs that show a single variable (e.g. one-variable bar charts, histograms, density estimates).

5.  Each group is required to make at least three of the following types of graphs:  

+  Choropleth maps
+  Other maps
+  Network diagrams
+  Time series plots
+  Dendrograms
+  Graphs relating to text analysis

6.  Each group is required to use Plotly in at least two of their graphs.  For examples on Plotly, see here:

+  [https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/index.html]
+  [http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_plotly.html]
+  [https://plot.ly/r/]


7.  Each group is required to use an HTML Widget (other than Plotly) in at least one of their graphs.  For examples on HTML Widgets, see here:

+  [http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_threejs.html]
+  [http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/]

##  Submission

1.  Each group is required to visit Matey's office hours (see below) to go over their ideas for their project.  Each group should have a version of all of their graphs completed for this meeting.

Matey's office hours:

+  Monday, 12/11, 9am-noon
+  Monday, 12/11, 2-3pm
+  Monday, 12/11, 4-7:30pm

2.  You should design your Shiny apps so that they work on any computer.  Reading data from a public location, or from a location within the directory containing the Shiny app, is the best strategy to ensure that they work on other computers. 

3.  The version of your app that is posted to ShinyApps.io on Wednesday, 12/13 at 9am is the version that will be graded.

#  Task 2:  Oral Presentation of your Shiny App

**(8% of your Final Grade)**

Each group will present their Shiny apps to Matey, the TAs, other students in the course, other professors, and Statistics graduate students.

##  Presentation Requirements

+  Each group member is required to speak about two graphics.  These do not have to be the graphics they created, but it probably makes sense to do so.

+  Be professional and courteous to anyone in the audience.  Assume that they do not know anything about your dataset, and be sure to explain the dataset / questions you're trying to answer in a clear and concise way.

+  Your group will have 15 minutes to present your entire Shiny app, followed by 5-10 minutes of follow-up questions from anyone in the audience.

+  Groups will be graded based on how well they work as a group and describe their data during their presentation.  For example, transitions between graphs, group members, etc should be smooth.  Individuals should refer to other graphics presented by other members of their group when appropriate.

+  Individuals will be graded based on their explanations of their graphics.  How well do they describe what's being plotted?  How well do they describe the main takeways of the graph?  How well do they describe any relationships, distributions, associations, patterns, etc in each graph?  Does the individual speak in a professional manner?  Does the individual avoid the overuse of words like "so", "um", "uh", etc?  Does the individual use the interactive features to demonstrate some interesting feature of the dataset / to answer some question that otherwise would not be seen / answered?

+  Individuals who do not present at least two graphics will lose a substantial portion of their grade for the presentation portion.  Individuals who do not show up to their group presentation will receive a 0 (except in the case of extreme circumstances / emergency / etc).


##  Submission

No submission is required for this task, other than:

+  showing up on time with all group members
+  turning in your assignment in Task 1 on time
